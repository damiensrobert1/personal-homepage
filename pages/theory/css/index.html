      <h2>Flexbox</h2>
      <p>The main axis (horizontal) is used to position flex items with the following properties:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>justify-content</li>
        <li>flex-wrap</li>
        <li>flex-grow</li>
        <li>flex-shrink</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The cross axis (vertical) is used to position flex items with the following properties:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>align-items</li>
        <li>align-content</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      with justify-content :
      flex-start — all items will be positioned in order, starting from the left of the parent container, with no extra space between or before them.
    flex-end — all items will be positioned in order, with the last item starting on the right side of the parent container, with no extra space between or after them.
    center — all items will be positioned in order, in the center of the parent container with no extra space before, between, or after them.
    space-around — items will be positioned with equal space before and after each item, resulting in double the space between elements.
    space-between — items will be positioned with equal space between them, but no extra space before the first or after the last elements.

    The main axis and cross axis are interchangeable. We can switch them using the flex-direction property. If we add the flex-direction property and give it a value of column, the flex items will be ordered vertically, not horizontally.

    The flex-direction property can accept four values:

    row — elements will be positioned from left to right across the parent element starting from the top left corner (default).
    row-reverse — elements will be positioned from right to left across the parent element starting from the top right corner.
    column — elements will be positioned from top to bottom of the parent element starting from the top left corner.
    column-reverse — elements will be positioned from the bottom to the top of the parent element starting from the bottom left corner.

      <h2>Grid</h2>
        <h3>grid container</h3>
          <p>display: grid or display: inline-grid</p>
          <p>grid-template-columns</p>
          <p>grid-template-rows</p>
          <p>fraction. Exemple: 1fr</p>
          <p>repeat et minmax</p>
	  <p>
	  The align-items property is used on a grid container. It’s used to determine how the grid items are spread out along the column by setting the default align-self property for all child grid items.

The value start aligns grid items to the top side of the grid area.
The value end aligns grid items to the bottom side of the grid area.
The value center aligns grid items to the center of the grid area.
The value stretch stretches all items to fill the grid area.


Align Content

Some times the total size of the grid items can be smaller than the grid container. If this is the case, the CSS property align-content can be used to position the entire grid along the column axis of the grid container.

The property is declared on the grid container.
The value start aligns the grid to the top of the grid container.
The value end aligns the grid to the bottom of the grid container.
The value center centers the grid vertically in the grid container.
The value stretch stretches the grid items to increase the size of the grid to expand vertically across the container.
The value space-around includes an equal amount of space on each side of a grid element, resulting in double the amount of space between elements as there is before the first and after the last element.
The value space-between includes an equal amount of space between grid items and no space at either end.
The value space-evenly places an even amount of space between grid items and at either end.</p>
        <h3>grid items</h3>
          <p>grid-area is: grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, grid-column-end.</p>
	  <p>span</p>
	  <p>grid-gap</p>
	<h3>auto rows and columns</h3>
	  <p>grid-auto-rows</p>
	  <p>grid-auto-columns</p>

      <h2>Transitions</h2>
        <pre>
a {

  transition-property: background-color;
  transition-duration: 2s;
}
        </pre>
The next transition property is transition-timing-function. The timing function describes the pace of the transition.

The default value is ease, which starts the transition slowly, speeds up in the middle, and slows down again at the end.

Other valid values include:

    ease-in — starts slow, accelerates quickly, stops abruptly
    ease-out — begins abruptly, slows down, and ends slowly
    ease-in-out — starts slow, gets fast in the middle, and ends slowly
    linear — constant speed throughout

    Our last transition property is <strong>transition-delay</strong>. Much like duration, its value is an amount of time. Delay specifies the time to wait before starting the transition. As with the duration property, the default value for transition-delay is 0s, which means no delay.
        <pre>
transition: color 1.5s linear 0.5s;
	</pre>
	<pre>
	transition: color 1s linear,
font-size 750ms ease-in 100ms;
	</pre>
The above code transitions two properties at once thanks to the coma.

      <h2>Transformations</h2>
	Let’s take a look at a simple @keyframes I’ve named “bounceIn”. This @keyframes has three stages. At the first stage (0%), the element is at opacity 0 and scaled down to 10 percent of its default size, using CSS transform scale. At the second stage (60%) the element fades in to full opacity and grows to 120 percent of its default size. At the final stage (100%), it scales down slightly and returns to its default size.

The @keyframes are added to your main CSS file.
        <pre>
@keyframes bounceIn {
  0% {
    transform: scale(0.1);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  60% {
    transform: scale(1.2);
    opacity: 1;
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}
        </pre>
        <pre>
div {
  animation-duration: 2s;
  animation-name: bounceIn;
}
        </pre>

Shorthand syntax:

        <pre>
div {
  animation: bounceIn 2s;
}
        </pre>
