.breadcrumb li+li::before

The + is called the adjacent sibling combinator; it will only select two liâ€˜s when they are immediately next to each other, with the same parent. The element that actually gets selected is the second element of this sibling pair.

The ::before part of this selector creates a pseudo-element. The ::before pseudo-element is often used with the content property, to add content that will be displayed just before the selected element.
